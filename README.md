The objective of RemoteRWT is to establish processes and systems for real-world tokenization in remote locations of the world, specifically the mountain region of the Andes.

Remote locations are the source of many assets however the conditions there may not be suited to minting tokens. Minting in remote locations is not a specific objective of many solutions that exist today.
Remote locations provide distinct challenges such as no power source or no internet connection.
The Andean region offers a variety of objects that can benefit from tokenization such as minerals and foods. 

Perhaps a distinct coin to facilitate transactions across borders would be helpful.
How are crypto coins used to facilitate international transactions?
TODO: Understand import export laws

Jose Collas is well suited to understanding the region because of his Peruvian citizenship as well as his long time involvement in the region. The object may have to travel long distances to its final owner. This path can be documented with a block chain entry. Jose has years of development work and looks forward to continuing his career using Hedera in a working position.

The target leger system used will be Hedera. Hedera has the potential to be, in the future, the established leger solution for the problems trying to be solved here.

Some of the key characteristics of Hedera that set it up for the long term are its efficiency and organization set up.
Hedera that set it up for the long term are its efficient hashgraph consensus.
The Hedera foundation is likely to be the same to years to come. It is unlikely that Hedera would be purchased by another company then changed. I have experience with Hedera as a result of participating in several Hedera hackathons.

### Architecture Diagram

Mobile device records initial verification and records conditions.
Characteristics such as weight, size, latitude, longitude, temperature, photographs of the object
This record is recorded locally(?) or is taken to a base station that is connected to the internet.

At the source location the item will be minted.
Local block chain running on Mobile device.
Base station laptop with internet connection.

A web page will be provide where a user of the product can log in to see information about the token or to make transactions.

Facilitate knowledge about minted item.
a user can see a listing of tokens, visualization can be used to show geographical, temporal information.

Facilitate transactions
Give option to list item in online shops.
Conversion of crypto coin to currencies, 

### User Journey

User has a set of equipment that enables minting in remote locations.
Upon discovery or harvest the item is minted.
Records are made of its condition and recorded as part of the token.
